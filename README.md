# Data Analyst Assessment

### Assessment_Q1
#### Challenges
- The business requires records of customers who have at least one funded savings account and one funded investment account. I initially struggled with the script because I was unfamiliar with the table structures, which resulted in null values in the output that did not meet the requirements.
- After revising my understanding, I created a correct script; however, it timed out during execution which became a challenge to me.
